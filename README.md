# ICS-to-GClassroom
Take ICS files and make Google Classroom assignments based off of them

Input the name of the folder containing the ICS files. For each file inside the
folder, ask the user if they want to keep the assignment or not. After the user
entered an input for every file, make an event with only the data of the files
the user wanted to keep. Then, create assignments for every event. If the event
is in the past, make the assignment without a due date.
